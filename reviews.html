The decor inside the building is super cool. Plenty of room as well as far as seating goes. We were greeted immediately upon walking up to where you place your order. The young man taking our order was very friendly and helpful. He was giving recommendations and offered us the days special. We both ended up just getting chopped brisket potatoes, an order of brisket cheese fries, and some of the jalepeno cheese sausage. Everything was absolutely amazing and even better than delivery being you get to eat it right off the line. There was a manger walking constantly checking on people, cleaning up, and just supporting his staff. We were truly impressed. I would definitely eat here if you haven't. Can't wait to go back!!",

My husband got the 3 meat trio with pulled pork, moist brisket, and ribs the flavors were undescribable other than mouth watering! The smoke flavor was a solid 10/10 for those who expect that smokehouse taste you can get at home! I got the 16oz Ribeye and oh my goodness the marbling in the steak was truly beautiful and held the steak seasoning 🤤 🤤 I got mine cooked rare and could have used a spoon to cut it. Finally we finished with peach cobbler with ice cream! Overall the place is amazing and we will be returning with empty stomachs and high expectations!",

Both gentlemen made my family and I experience worth more than we can afford. Mr. Philip assisted us once prior and has been amazing every visit. Mr. Ordacio acknowledged my family and I upon entrance and greeted us with a smile, before we settled into our seats he was there to greet and assist us. He even made my 2 year old smile and I asked do you like him, he smiled ear to ear and said yes. We will definitely becoming back and seeing these two gentlemen will make our visit that much more worth the while.",

                "reviewBody": "I always enjoy eating here at Red River BBQ & Burger. The interior is beautifully decorated with mounts of deer, moose, trout, and pheasants. The atmosphere feels like an outdoor one, with all the taxidermy and images of fishermen. The food is incredible. I usually order a bacon cheeseburger or the Smokehouse burger, both of which are delicious, but I decided to switch things up a bit this time. I ordered the peanut butter cut brisket with macaroni and cheese and potato salad. This meal was great; I couldn't finish it all, as the portion was large and the food was filling. The brisket was tender and tasted amazing when paired with the barbecue sauce. The sides acted as a nice complement. My mother ordered the chicken fried steak, which she said tasted great. The breading could be a little crispier but the meat was tender. Overall, you should come here if you're in the area. It will be an experience that will leave you feeling happy.",

A couple of us had sweet potato fries and mentioned that they were not as crispy as we like them. They immediately made a new batch for us! Philip helped us so much and made the evening even better with his professional and kind manner! A great family place with great food!",

From the moment I walked in, I was greeted by friendly and helpful staff, which set the tone for the rest of my visit. The atmosphere was warm and inviting, perfect for a casual meal with family or friends. The food was absolutely delicious. The BBQ ribs and brisket were cooked to perfection, tender and flavorful. The BBQ sauce was a standout, adding just the right amount of sweetness to the meat. The potato salad was a delightful side, complementing the main dishes perfectly. What really stood out to me was the consistency in the quality of the food. Every dish was prepared with care and attention to detail. The portions were generous, and the prices were reasonable, making it a great value for the money. Overall, Red River BBQ & Burger exceeded my expectations in every way. Whether you're a BBQ enthusiast or just looking for a great place to eat, I highly recommend giving this restaurant a try. You won't be disappointed!",

                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">This place is absolutely amazing to be honest. We have eaten here several times but via delivery. Today we decided to go in and dine in. The decor inside the building is super cool. Plenty of room as well as far as seating goes. We were greeted immediately upon walking up to where you place your order. The young man taking our order was very friendly and helpful. He was giving recommendations and offered us the days special. We both ended up just getting chopped brisket potatoes, an order of brisket cheese fries, and some of the jalepeno cheese sausage. Everything was absolutely amazing and even better than delivery being you get to eat it right off the line. There was a manger walking constantly checking on people, cleaning up, and just supporting his staff. We were truly impressed. I would definitely eat here if you haven't. Can't wait to go back!!</p>

                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">This was our first time trying Red River BBQ and we were blown out of the water! The food is amazing! My husband got the 3 meat trio with pulled pork, moist brisket, and ribs the flavors were undescribable other than mouth watering! The smoke flavor was a solid 10/10 for those who expect that smokehouse taste you can get at home! I got the 16oz Ribeye and oh my goodness the marbling in the steak was truly beautiful and held the steak seasoning 🤤 🤤 I got mine cooked rare and could have used a spoon to cut it. Finally we finished with peach cobbler with ice cream! Overall the place is amazing and we will be returning with empty stomachs and high expectations!</p>

                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">I always enjoy eating here at Red River BBQ & Burger. The interior is beautifully decorated with mounts of deer, moose, trout, and pheasants. The atmosphere feels like an outdoor one, with all the taxidermy and images of fishermen. The food is incredible. I usually order a bacon cheeseburger or the Smokehouse burger, both of which are delicious, but I decided to switch things up a bit this time. I ordered the peanut butter cut brisket with macaroni and cheese and potato salad. This meal was great; I couldn't finish it all, as the portion was large and the food was filling. The brisket was tender and tasted amazing when paired with the barbecue sauce. The sides acted as a nice complement. My mother ordered the chicken fried steak, which she said tasted great. The breading could be a little crispier but the meat was tender. Overall, you should come here if you're in the area. It will be an experience that will leave you feeling happy.</p>

We all ordered something different- shrimp- ribs- hamburger - brisket sandwiches and plate- it was all very good! A couple of us had sweet potato fries and mentioned that they were not as crispy as we like them. They immediately made a new batch for us! Philip helped us so much and made the evening even better with his professional and kind manner! A great family place with great food!</p>

Both gentlemen made my family and I experience worth more than we can afford. Mr. Philip assisted us once prior and has been amazing every visit. Mr. Ordacio acknowledged my family and I upon entrance and greeted us with a smile, before we settled into our seats he was there to greet and assist us. He even made my 2 year old smile and I asked do you like him, he smiled ear to ear and said yes. We will definitely becoming back and seeing these two gentlemen will make our visit that much more worth the while.</p>

                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">I recently had the pleasure of dining at Red River BBQ & Burger in League City, Texas, and I must say, it was an outstanding experience! From the moment I walked in, I was greeted by friendly and helpful staff, which set the tone for the rest of my visit. The atmosphere was warm and inviting, perfect for a casual meal with family or friends. The food was absolutely delicious. The BBQ ribs and brisket were cooked to perfection, tender and flavorful. The BBQ sauce was a standout, adding just the right amount of sweetness to the meat. The potato salad was a delightful side, complementing the main dishes perfectly. What really stood out to me was the consistency in the quality of the food. Every dish was prepared with care and attention to detail. The portions were generous, and the prices were reasonable, making it a great value for the money. Overall, Red River BBQ & Burger exceeded my expectations in every way. Whether you're a BBQ enthusiast or just looking for a great place to eat, I highly recommend giving this restaurant a try. You won't be disappointed!</p>
